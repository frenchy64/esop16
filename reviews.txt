> Clojure is a dynamically typed language in the Lisp family which runs on the Java Virtual Machine. It provides interoperability with Java codes, allowing programmers to use existing Java libraries within Clojure programs. The paper presents an optional type system for Clojure, building on the approach of the gradual type system in Typed Racket. 
> The authors extend occurrence typing of Typed Racket to handle Clojure-specific features, such as interoperability with Java and multimethods, and programming idioms such as exceptional control flow and heterogeneous maps. The paper formally defines the type system, which is proved sound with respect to an operational semantics. The type system is implemented as a Clojure library, which inserts an external static analysis pass in the compiler.

Heterogeneous maps, Java interop and multimethods do not interact with polymorphism in interesting ways, as in polymorphic
variants

We agree. Typed Clojure does not interact with Java generics, a point that needs justification and discussion.

We failed to note that Typed Clojure fully expands macros before type checking. Clojure pattern matching and contract
libraries expand to do and if expressions, so the flow analysis presented in Section 2 is essential to type checking
such expansions.

The reviewer is correct. Example 11 should state 

  (path (File. "dir/a")) ;=> "dir/a"

and the isa? test should be

  (isa? (class (File. "dir/a")) File)

We sketch '=' in terms of 'isa?' in section 3.3.

isa? is implemented as a type rule in Section 3.5, with the limitation that we cannot check 
higher-order usages in the formulation or implementation. isa? is mostly used only for multimethod
dispatch in first-order contexts.

This was not clearly distinguished. In general, Typed Clojure adds no runtime extensions
but instead only macros to help annotating expressions.

We were not explicit about our contributions. This claim was intended to be informative to
give context to our contributions in the rest of the section.

Agreed, our explanation of the :complete option of HMap is imprecise.
:complete is a boolean HMap option, a static type, which specifies whether :mandatory
or :optional entries fully specify the HMap (ie. contains no further entries).

We moved all mentions of ^File metadata to Section 2.6.

Mentioning this syntax was a mistake: ^File expands to {:tag File}.
FIXME remove this syntax.

The type hint is File, stored in the metadata map under :tag.

We intend the paper to be self-contained.

We agree this is a problem. We will instead remove all references to extraneous
syntax.

We will remove 'ns' forms and the discussion on namespaces from the paper,
instead directing to the runnable examples in Footnote 2 for these details.

We will fully explain keywords as they are integral to the paper.

We will remove :require and :refer-clojure from the paper.

A "var" is a global variable. We will clarify this.

"check-ns" is how programmers trigger type checking. We will elaborate
on its usages.

We will replace mentions of "vars" with "global variables", which is their role in Clojure.

Fixed typo.

We will remove the dot notation 

  (Exception.) 
  
and instead use more intuitive 'new' special form

Correct.

We will now start section 2.7 with a thorough explanation of isa?, before connecting
it with multimethods.

We chose these three features explicitly to show the effectiveness of occurrence typing
outside the system in which it was designed for, Typed Racket.
We will stress these points in a section by itself.

We believe heterogeneous maps demonstrate the compositionally and scalability
of occurrence typing beyond cons cells and syntax objects [FIXME ICFP10], but multimethods
show a unique application of occurrence typing FIXME .......

We intended this example to demonstrate backwards reasoning, but is irrelevant to the paper.

We support exceptional control flow with a simple rule that is a clean
extension to the original occurrence typing formulation.
Typed Racket subsequently supported this feature after our Typed Clojure implementation,
several years after occurrence typing was invented.
This helped check more Racket programs, a key goal of Typed Racket, which indicates
the subtle nature of our solution.

Agreed, however this is part of a larger story.

We respectfully disagree. 

OCaml Java, which uses the OCaml Typer has nullable reference types.

  val null : 'a java_instance

Nullable references can be manually turned into an option type, but the type
system does not prevent null-pointer exceptions in OCaml code.

  val wrap : 'a java_instance -> 'a java_instance option

In contrast, null is explicit in Typed Clojure, so typed code cannot
throw null-pointer exceptions.

Scala has similar properties to OCaml Java in this respect.

The reviewer seems to have overlooked our approach of integrating multimethods

We agree Typed Clojure can be uglier than Clojure, our aim was
to minimize the amount of code programmers must change to port untyped code, which we believe we achieved
to an acceptable degree.

> - probably highly specific to Clojure

Our approach to exceptional control flow has been adopted by Typed Racket.
The combination of unions 

> - just a zoo of features, what’s the deeper insight?

We demonstrate the generality of occurrence typing beyond its original purposes.
Occurrence typing was initially designed to reason about conditional expressions by recording
information based on what a test expression implies when checking the 'then' and 'else' branches.

Section 3.1 shows the straightforward encoding of exceptional control flow.

We compositionally add support for HMap- and tag-based control flow via path elements.
The complexity of the 'update' cases for each of these shows their non-trivial nature
in design and implementation, again without fundamental extensions to occurrence typing.

Finally, the encoding of multimethod dispatch via occurrence typing is unexpectedly direct .

> - potential algorithmic complexity

Using well known [FIXME ICFP10] optimizations

> This work is about retro-fitting a type system onto Clojure, a Lisp-like language on the JVM. It uses the existing approach of occurrence typing (as known from Typed Racket), and extends it piecemeal with features needed for Clojure. For the Clojure community, there is high practical value in such work, and the system is already seeing industrial use.

We agree.

> I also wonder how well type checking scales. Some of the examples in the paper show a manual encoding of pattern matching. To achieve enough precision, the propositional logic in the occurrence type system has to be powerful enough to track exhaustiveness of such patterns -- and as far as I can see, it is. However, such an analysis is known to be combinatorially expensive, and typical implementations in typed functional languages use more compact notions of abstract values for tracking positive and negative information about patterns. Here, all this information has to be encoded in the most naive manner, using a simple propositional logic over singleton assertions. I am concerned that doesn’t behave well on large matches.
