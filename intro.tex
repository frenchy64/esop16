\section{Clojure with static typing}

% current situation 

Programming is an error prone activity, especially in the presence of
multiple languages working together. Over the past decade, it has become increasingly
frequent to extend existing dynamically typed languages with optional type systems.
The guarantees that a sound type system provides can be the difference between
choosing a language that supports a type system or one that does not.

% presenting clojure

Clojure is a dynamically typed language built to run on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM)
which has recently gained popularity as an alternative JVM language.
It offers the flexibility of a Lisp dialect, including Common Lisp-style macros,
emphasising a functional style via a standard library of immutable datastructures. 
Clojure has good interoperability with existing Java code, allowing programmers to
use existing Java libaries without leaving Clojure.

Clojure

Typed Clojure is a gradual type system for Clojure, based on the
static portion of Typed Racket.

\begin{lstlisting}
(ann parent [(U nil File) -> (U nil File)])
(defn parent [^File f]
  (when f
    (let [s (. f (getParent))]
      (assert s "Expected parent string, got nil")
      (new File s))))
\end{lstlisting}

%$$
%\abs{\x{}}{\Union{\Nil}{\File}}
%{\letexp {\hinted{\File{}}{f}} {f}
%  {\ifexp {f} 
%    {\letexp {s} {\methodstaticexp {\File{}} {\String{}} {\String{}} {getParent} {f}}
%      {\doexp {\ifexp {s}
%                {\nil{}}
%                {\errorval{input}}}
%              {\newstaticexp {\String{}} {\File{}} {\File{}} {s}}}}
%    {\nil{}}
%}}
%              $$

%(some-> f (.getParent) (File.) (.getParent))

%\begin{lstlisting}
%(ann parent [(U nil File) -> (U nil String)])
%(defn parent [^File f]
%  (when f
%    (.getParent f)))
%\end{lstlisting}

\begin{lstlisting}
(defalias Expr
  (U '{:op :if :test Expr :then Expr :else Expr}
     '{:op :const :val Any} ...))
(ann tree-str [Expr -> String])
(defmulti tree-str (fn [e :- Expr] (get :op e)))
(defmethod tree-str :if [{:keys [test then else]}] 
  (str (tree-str test) (tree-str then) (tree-str else)))
(defmethod tree-str :const [{:keys [val]}] 
  (str val))
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Contributions}

%The main idea is....... SPJ
In this paper we present a practical type system for Clojure.

\begin{itemize}

  \item We formalise Typed Clojure and prove that typed code
    \begin{itemize}
      \item disallows null-pointer exceptions, (Section ?)
      \item statically resolves Java interoperability (Section ?)
    \end{itemize}
  \item We reveal the surprising synthesis between Clojure multimethods
        and occurrence typing.
  \item We 
\end{itemize}

% what are the goals of Typed Clojure?
% where do they differ from Typed Racket? why?

% Things todo
% - DONE small calculus based on previous TR formalisation
%   that demos the ``flow'' environment & not/intersection type
% - discussion and examples for flow filters
% - discussion on the not/difference type, real code where it helps
% - higher-rank polymorphism, show what it enables (eg. monads)
%   - also show more complicated example, making an extensible
%     type for clojure.core/conj, and why it's not straightforward
% - discussion on limitations of local type inference
% - demonstration of how we check multimethods
% - dealing with array covariance
% - note on how we avoid null-pointer exceptions
% - discussion on why Typed Clojure only uses the ``static'' part
%   of Typed Racket
% - the equality filter problem (and draft solution?), a proposition
%   that knows about binding aliasing. Sounds straightforward?
